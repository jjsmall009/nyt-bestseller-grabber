How to Use
==========================================================
In case I'm not around to troubleshoot anything or fix any bugs, here's some basic instructions.

1. Make sure you have the config file as specified below.
2. Run the file "bestseller_grabber.exe".
3. The results are in the results folder.

===
Configuration
===
In order for the program to run correctly you need to have a folder called "config" and in it and
file called "config.ini". There should be one already there so if there isn't than good luck.

- Values in the config file are case sensitive (Yes/No).

===
API
===
An API is a way of getting data from an external source. I.e. a website that has some data you want.

This program uses data from the New York Times developer API portal (https://developer.nytimes.com/). Create
an account and setup your own API key if mine stops working.
